# Random Password Generator

## About Our App

Every day, every hour and every second millions of users log in to different websites using their user id, e-mail or phone number, but what remains common for all of them are the passwords. But a user may have different accounts in different websites, and if the passwords for all these websites remains the same, it becomes easy for hackers to get access over all of them. This is why it is advisable to keep seperate passwords for different accounts you log into. Although it is not an easy task to always come up with a good password that is secure and easy to remember. Don't worry, we've got you.

Our app is built to generate random passwords of 15 characters ranging from alphabets to special characters. Everytime you click on "Generate Passwords" button, two freshly-generated passwords are displayed below. If you click on to the passwords, it gets automatically copied to your clipboard so that you can save and re-use it whenever you want.
